## Project Explanation

This project demonstrates the ability to build a **clean, static, and responsive web page** using only **HTML and CSS**, following modern frontend fundamentals.

The focus of this project is not on interactivity, but on:
- Clear content structure
- Semantic markup
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Proper separation of concerns between HTML and CSS

The page is fully functional without JavaScript, ensuring accessibility and graceful degradation.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to structure content using **semantic HTML**
- Understanding of **mobile-first CSS design**
- Basic responsive layout techniques
- Clear navigation using anchor links
- Readable and maintainable CSS styling

---

## Key Learnings — HTML

- Difference between **semantic elements** (`header`, `nav`, `section`, `footer`) and generic containers
- Importance of using semantic HTML for:
  - Accessibility
  - Readability
  - Maintainability
- Proper use of anchor links (`href="#section-id"`) for in-page navigation
- Understanding that HTML is responsible for **structure and meaning**, not styling or behavior

---

## Key Learnings — CSS

- Applying **mobile-first design** by writing base styles for small screens first
- Using `margin` and `padding` correctly for layout and spacing
- Styling navigation differently for mobile and larger screens
- Understanding how simple media queries enhance layout without overcomplicating CSS
- Keeping CSS explicit and readable instead of over-abstracted

---

## Design Decisions

- Navigation works without JavaScript to ensure accessibility
- Layout remains simple to emphasize fundamentals over visual polish
- CSS avoids advanced patterns to focus on core concepts

---

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundation for understanding how **HTML and CSS work together** to create structured, responsive web pages.  
The concepts practiced here form the base for more advanced frontend and full-stack projects.
