# Zatch Motors Webpages:

## Problem Statement
    Build a horizontal navigation bar with 4 links (Home, Models, Gallery, Contact) and style it with CSS.

    <> Extended: Wrap this into a basic car showcase site with:
        > Home page → welcome text.
        > Models page → list of 3 car names (linked to external images).
        > Gallery page → 2–3 car images with captions.
        > Contact page → simple form (Name, Email, Phone, Submit).
        > Footer → “© 2025 Zatch Motors.”

## Deliverables
    <> nav_bar.html (main page with nav bar + footer).
    <> nav_bar.css (styles for nav bar).
    <> Home.html, Models.html, Gallery.html, Contact.html (linked pages).
