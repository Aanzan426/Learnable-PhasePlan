# Daily PHP Learning Log



## Disclaimer



This repository is a **learning journal and practice space** documenting my day-to-day progress while studying PHP and related backend fundamentals.



The notes, examples, and explanations added here reflect:

- My current understanding at the time of writing

- Concepts as they become relevant during hands-on practice

- Incremental learning rather than finalized or production-grade documentation



As a result:

- Some explanations may evolve or be refined over time

- Code examples prioritize clarity and learning value over optimization

- Structure and depth may vary across entries based on feasibility and focus on fundamentals



This repository should be viewed as a **transparent record of learning and growth**, not as a polished reference or authoritative guide. Improvements and refinements will be made as understanding deepens.



The intent is to demonstrate **consistency, reasoning, and problem-solving progression**, rather than perfection.
