## Project Title
Interactive Valentine Proposal Website

## Problem Statement
Modern digital interactions often lack emotional engagement and personalization. Traditional proposal messages such as plain texts, images, or static web pages fail to create anticipation, excitement, and playful interaction.

The objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive web-based proposal system that simulates human emotions such as curiosity, suspense, playfulness, and persistence. The system should dynamically react to user behavior and progressively guide the user toward a final response while maintaining engagement.

The website must:
- Provide a cinematic introduction experience
- Ask a personalized proposal question
- Detect and react to rejection attempts
- Prevent negative response after multiple attempts
- Create emotional continuity using time tracking
- Redirect to a final response confirmation page

The solution will be implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, ensuring compatibility with mobile devices and browsers without requiring external frameworks.
