# Profile Page (DOM Manipulation (HTML/CSS/JS))

 ## Problem Statement:
     <> Display a profile card with name, age, and course.
     <> Buttons to update the displayed course and change text color.
     <> Input box → button adds a new hobby to the profile list dynamically.
     <> Extended: Style the profile card with CSS (borders, spacing, fonts).

 ## Deliverables:
     <> profile.html → main page with profile card, buttons, input box.
     <> profile.css → styles for layout and design.
     <> profile.js → DOM manipulation logic (update text, change color, add hobby).
